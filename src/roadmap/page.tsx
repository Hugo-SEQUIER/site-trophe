                        <p>Ensuring the security of our solution is paramount. We will conduct comprehensive security audits to identify and mitigate any vulnerabilities. This process will involve thorough testing of our encryption methods, data storage solutions, and overall system architecture to ensure robust protection against potential threats.<br/>
                        We will move into the alpha testing phase, where our initial version of the AI solution will be tested internally. This phase will help us identify bugs, gather user feedback, and make necessary improvements. It will also allow us to assess the performance and functionality of our solution in a controlled environment.<br/> 
                        Concurrently, we will focus on developing a user-friendly API that allows seamless integration with other systems and applications. This API will provide access to our AI functionalities, making it easier for developers and businesses to leverage our solution. Ensuring the API is well-documented, secure, and efficient will be a top priority.<br/>
                        By following these steps, we will ensure that our AI solution is secure, thoroughly tested, and easily accessible through a robust API.
